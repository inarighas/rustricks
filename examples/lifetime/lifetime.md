## Purpose

In Rust, a lifetime refers to the scope of validity of a reference. A reference is a type of pointer that points to some data stored elsewhere.

Lifetimes are used to enforce the ownership and borrowing rules in Rust, which ensure that references are used in a safe and secure way. For example, a reference can't outlive the data it points to, otherwise it would be dangling and pointing to invalid memory.

The purpose of lifetimes is to help prevent memory safety issues, such as null or dangling pointer references, which can lead to crashes or security vulnerabilities. By specifying lifetimes in your code, the Rust compiler can verify that your references are used correctly and prevent these kinds of errors from happening.

## Starting example

Let's consider this code example:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string");
    let string2 = String::from("short");

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    println!("The longest string is: {}", result);
}
```

In this example, the `longest` function takes two string slices `x` and `y` as arguments and returns a string slice that references the longest of the two. The lifetime annotations `'a` ensure that the returned string slice references one of the input string slices and will not outlive it.

Note that we convert the `String` values to string slices using the `as_str` method before passing them to the `longest` function. This is because the `longest` function expects string slices, not `String` values.

## Lifetime Annotation

The apostrophe (`'`) in a lifetime annotation such as `'a` is used to declare a lifetime in Rust.

Lifetimes are a way of specifying the relationships between references in Rust programs. They help ensure that references are valid and won't be used after the data they point to has been deallocated.

The lifetime annotations in the parameter `x: &'a str` and `y: &'a str` of the function longest specify that x and y are string slice references with the same lifetime `'a`. The returned reference `&'a str` also has the same lifetime `'a`.

The purpose of the lifetime annotations is to ensure that the returned reference points to a valid string slice and will not outlive either of the input string slices. Without the lifetime annotations, the Rust compiler wouldn't be able to guarantee the validity of the returned reference, and would reject the code.

## A note about ownership and borrowing in Rust

Ownership and borrowing are two core concepts in Rust that govern how memory is managed in a Rust program.

Ownership refers to the idea that each value in Rust has a single owner. The owner is responsible for cleaning up the value's memory when it is no longer needed. When the owner goes out of scope, the memory is automatically deallocated. This eliminates the need for a garbage collector, and makes Rust programs fast and efficient.

Borrowing refers to the ability to create a reference to some data that is owned by another value. References allow you to access the data without taking ownership of it. When a reference goes out of scope, the original value and its ownership are unaffected. This allows multiple parts of a program to access the same data without having to constantly pass ownership back and forth.

The rules for ownership and borrowing in Rust ensure that memory is used in a safe and secure way. For example, Rust ensures that there is never more than one mutable reference to some data at the same time, which eliminates the risk of data races and other concurrency-related bugs.

In summary, ownership and borrowing in Rust provide a way to manage memory that is safe, efficient, and easy to understand.
